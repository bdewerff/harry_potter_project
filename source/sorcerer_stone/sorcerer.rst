Brief Overview
--------------
          
In the first installment of the Harry Potter series, the story begins with 
Lord Voldemort killing Harry Potter's parents, however the curse rebounds 
back into Voldemort. Afterwards, Harry is left with his negligent relatives, 
the Dursley family. 

When Harry turns 11, many letters were sent to their 
residence, but the Dursleys wouldn't allow Harry to read them. 
Eventually a large man, Hagrid, comes to help and introduces him to the 
*Wizardry World* and the school Hogwarts. 

His first friends become Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. 
When arriving at Hogwarts, Harry is placed in the Gryffindor house. 

Harry, Hermione, and Ron discover a three-headed dog, Fluffy, that 
is guarding a trap door. They learn it is guarding the **Sorcerer's 
Stone**, which can be used for the Elixir of Life to grant who drinks it, 
immortality. Throughout the plot the three friends believe Snape is 
trying to steal the **Sorcerer's Stone**, but after surpassing 
Fluffy and traversing the school's security system, they find out 
Professor Quirrell was attempting to steal it. Voldemort possesses 
Quirrell to try to harm Harry, but he crumbles when touching Harry 
because Harry's mother put magical protection from Voldemort onto Harry. 
In the end, the **Sorcerer's Stone** was destroyed to prevent Voldemort from 
attempting to steal it again.
