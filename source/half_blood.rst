Half-blood Prince
=================

Brief Overview
--------------

Lord Voldemort returns to power and death eaters wreak havoc on the wizarding 
world and the muggle world. Snape, a member of Dumbledore's anti-voldemort 
coalition meets with Drako's mom and makes the *Unbreakable-vow*.
All to protect her son Drako. In the past Snape has been rude to Harry 
throughout all the books. Dumbledore gets Harry from his aunt's and takes him 
to Professor Slughorn's house. dumbledore explains to Slughorn that he needs him 
to come back to Hogwarts and teach. He brought Harry as bait. 
While reunited with Hermione and Ron, Harry runs into Drako and the pack follow 
him to *Borgin and Burkes* where he sees DRako with a pack of death eaters and 
Drako yelling at the owner insisting he fix a broken object. They return to school 
and they all take a potions class taught by Proffesor Slughorn. Harry's potions book, 
has writing everywhere in it. Harry discovers the name *Half-blood prince* in the 
book and uses the notes written in it to perform insanely good potion making. 
Harry wins a prize due to this and wins *Liquid-luck* a potion to make the 
individual feel lucky and have luck. Dumbledore explains to Harry that he 
believes Slughorn holds the ultimate secret to defeating Dubldedore and asks 
Harry to retrieve a memory from him. Dubledore shows Harry one of his memories 
and explains that it has been altered as if slughorn knows he is guilty so he 
blocked the rest of it out. Harry discovers Draco is using the Room of Requirement 
for a vanishing cabinet to transfer from the castle to Borgin. Harry takes the 
liquid-luck eventually and gets Slughorn to follow him to Hagrids and as they 
all are drinking, Harry tells Slughorn he needs this memory or else everyone 
would have died for nothing. Slughorn gives him the memory and takes it to Dumbledore. 
They discover Voldemort had asked Slughorn about Holcraux's. Dumbledore is taken aback and fearful. 
Holcraux's are dark pieces of magic where you kill someone and place that part 
of your own soul into an object. Therefore, becoming immortal unless all Holcraux's are destroyed.
Dumbledore takes Harry with him to a place to find another Holcraux. 
They get it but later is found out that it is fake. They are on the top of the tower 
as Dumbledore hears people coming. He insists Harry hide. Bellatrix, Drako and a few 
other death eaters show up and Drako is ordered to kill Dumbledore. Drako disarms 
him instead and can't seem to do the job. Snape comes in and kills Dumbledore to 
keep Drako safe. Harry chases after them in fury and is knocked down by Snape as 
Snape tells him that he is the Half-blood Prince. Hermione Harry and Ron know 
that they now have to set out to find and destroy the Holcraux's to defeat Voldemort.
