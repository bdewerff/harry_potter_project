Overview
---------

The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's house of **Slytherin** is stereotypically
home to dark magic and wizards. Although this is the case for a good portion of the
house, there are several prominent leaders in the bunch who are proud ambitious 
and cunning. Slytherin was founded by Salazar Slytherin who believed pure-blood
students should be favored. A muggle-born student from Slytherin is quite rare. 

The crest symbol of Slytherin is a serpent and the house colors are green and 
silver. The heads of the house have included Severus Snape and Horace Slughorn. 
The ghost of Slytherin is the Bloody Baron. The common room of Slytherin is the 
Slytherin Dungeon. The house element for Slytherin is water because serpents are
associated with the sea in mythology and serpents are fluid animals. Water is 
also seen as a portal to another world in mythology. This relates to Slytherin's 
wish for a world of pure-bloods only.

Fun Facts
----------

Salazar Slytherin left Hogwarts after his controversial view that muggle-born
wizards are less than wizard-born or pure-blood wizards. Salazar left behind
**The Chamber of Secrets** for the purpose of it being opened one day and purging 
Hogwarts of those muggle-borns who he saw unfit to study magic.

Harry Potter himself was almost placed in Slytherin, but because he asked, was
placed in Gryffindor instead. 

Some notable Slytherins include Bellatrix Lestrange, Dolores Umbridge, Severus 
Snape, Tom Morvolo Riddle, Draco Malfoy and Merlin.
