Order of The Phoenix
====================

Brief Overview
--------------

This book is one of the longest books in the series. When Harry is back at Aunt Petunia's for the summer,
him and his cousin Dudley are visited by evil spirits called *Dementors*. These dementors work for the ministry of magic which is weird.
Harry uses a spell in front of Dudley to defend himself and is then expelled due to the the rule that wizards are not allowed to perform
magic spells in front of *Muggles*(Non-magics). Harry is then taken off to *Number Twelve* a secret society in the home of Harry's god father
Sirius Black. There, Harry learns about the *Order of The Phoenix*. The Order was organized by wizards fighting against Voldemort and was kept 
in secrecy for protection.
Before Hogwarts officially starts school, he attends a hearing to appeal his expulsion at the ministry. The minister of magic, Mr. Fudge,
Tries his best to sentence Harry to expulsion because of the little evidence that was found at the scene and proof of dementors there.
Dumbledore shows up late and brings in a witness to the hearing, and suggeests that someone in the ministry must be working with Voldemort.
Fudge has no choice due to the witness to remove all charges. When school starts, Fudge appoints a woman named Dolores Umbridge to *High Inquisistor*
to investigate Hogwarts and Dumbledore.
Harry tells Dumbledore and Snape about the visions and Dumbledore orders Harry to have lessons with Snape to try and keep Voldemort's visions out of his mind.
Harry gets frustrated and digs deep into the mind of Snape and discovers that his dad bullied him in school. Snape stops it and quits the lessons.
Dolores takes over Hogwarts eventually and tries to stop any kind of spell casting against dark arts. Harry discovers the room of requirement and gets
a huge group of students to join *Dumbledore's Army*. Here they practice defense spells against the dark arts and spells that could be usedul to them
if they were to ever come into contact with Voldemort or any of his death eaters. Malfoy and his goons discover this under Dolores' order and she finds the students and punishes them.
Harry starts having disturbing dreams suggesting that he is in Voldemort's mind. In one of the visions, Harry sees a large snake attacking Ron's father
in the ministry and warns the Order. They save Ron's father, but then Harry sees Sirius in the same room in the ministry. Hermione warns Harry that Voldemort 
could know about this connection and use it to lure him. Harry is too concerned about the consequences of losing Sirius so they venture to the Department of Mysteries and discover a ball that told Harry the prophecy. The prophecy states that neither one of them (Harry/Voldemort) would live. One of them must die. Lucious (Drako's Father) 
shows up just after the prophecy is discovered and demands Harry hand it over. Refusing, death eaters show up and the group excapes into a room but everyone but Harry is held at *Wand-point*. The Order, and Sirius shows up to fight off the death eaters and save the kids. Bellatrix La Strange kills Sirius and Harry is devastated. Dumbledore shows up
and casts them away. Harry falls to the ground as Voldemort gets into Harry's mind telling him they are the same person. Dumbledore tells HArry he has a power Voldemort does not know about. Dumbledore explains the power is love. Harry shoves Voldemort out of his head and Dumbldore fights Voldemort in person and casts him away. Fudge sees Voldemort and grants Dumbledore his job back and gets rid of Dolores. Harry is safe.
