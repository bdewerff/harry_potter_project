Prisoner of Azakaban
====================

Brief Overview
---------------

The third adventure in the Harry Potter series has Harry, Ron, and Hermione dealing
with Serius Black, a possible ally of Lord Voldemort. While staying with the Dursley
family, he learns Sirius Black has escaped prison. After losing control of his
emotions, Harry blows his Aunt Marge up like a balloon and leaves the Dursleys to
Diagon Alley. 

On the way to Hogwarts, Harry and his friends were stopped on the 
Hogwarts Express by a Dementor, the creatures that guard the wizard prison. Harry
faints because of this and is revived by the new, Professor Lupin. 

In his classes, the students were able to fight a Boggart, which turns 
into the student's greatest fear. Harry wasn't allowed to fight it because 
Lupin was afraid it would turn into Lord Voldemort. Sirius Black breaks into 
Hogwarts to destroy the Fat Lady portrait that guards the Gryffindor tower. 
During the first Quidditch game, there is a hoard of dementors, 
which causes Harry to faint and ultimately lose the match. 

After sneaking to Hogsmeade, Harry hears Sirius Black may be responsible 
for the death of his parents as well as other students in the school. 
Harry begins to work with Professor Lupin to learn the charm to fend off 
the dementors. 

Again, Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts at night and slashes the 
curtains around Ron's bed. During another Hogsmeade trip, Snape catches Harry, 
but luckily Lupin saved him from Snape's wrath. 

While leaving Hagrid's house after Buckbeak's (Hagrid's hippogriff) execution, 
a large black dog drags Ron underneath the Whomping Willow. After Crookshanks 
(Hermione's cat) stops the flailing tree, they enter a secret passage to the 
Shrieking Shack. They find the black dog is Sirius Black. Before they could attack him, 
Professor Lupin comes to calm them down. They explain how they were friends along 
with James Potter and Peter Pettigrew while at Hogwarts and how 
Professor Lupin is a werewolf. They reveal that Peter Pettigrew is Voldemort's servant 
and has been transformed as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, for years. Lupin then turns into
a werewolf and Black turns in the dog to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

Then a horde of dementors come to suck the soul out of Black and Harry,
however a mysterious patronus charm. Next, Harry wakes up in the hospital wing with 
Dumbledore wanting him and Hermione to go back in time to save Buckbeak. They do this,
then Harry goes to when the dementors came and discovers he is the one who saved himself
with the patronus charm. Hermione and Harry break Sirius Black out of prison and send 
him away with Buckbeak and Sirius gives Harry a permission slip to go to Hogsmeade.
