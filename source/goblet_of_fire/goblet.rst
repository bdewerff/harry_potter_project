Brief Overview
---------------

The fourth book starts with Harry having a vision Lord Voldemort kills Frank Bryce.
The next day, the Weasley's take Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup.
There, they meet Cedric Diggery. After the game, Death Eaters, Voldemort's
followers cause chaos and the Dark Mark is cast, which hasn't been seen in 13 years.
Winky, Barty Crouch's house elf, is a suspect to have casted it because he was found
with the wand that casted it. 

Hogwarts is selected to host the 
`Triwizard Tournament <https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/triwizard-tournament/>`_,
which can only be entered in by students older than 17. It is the first time the
tournament is being held in 200 years. The goblet picked the contenders as follows:

* Fleur Delacour - Beauxbatons
* Viktor Krum - Durmstrang
* Cedric Diggory - Hogwarts

However, Harry Potter's name is also picked, which sparks controversy since he is underage.

The first task requires Harry to retrieve a golden egg while a Hungarian Horntail is
trying to take him down. The egg is suppose to have a hint to the next task. He finishes
tied for first with Viktor. The egg shrieks when it is opened. 

At the Yule Ball, Harry is told by Cedric that he needs to take the egg to 
the prefects' bathroom. There, he discovers the next task will be underwater, 
so he researches spells that allow him to breath underwater. 
However, he is unsuccessful, so Dobby gives him a gillyweed.

They are required to save the person they care about the most. Harry ends up saving
Ron and Gabrielle, Fleur's sister. He is awarded 2nd place for this. 

The final task is in a hedge maze. Cedric and Harry agree to grab the Tournament Cup
at the same time, but it is a portkey to a graveyard. There, Peter Pettigrew kills Cedric 
and revives Lord Voldemort. Harry and Voldemort have a duel, but Harry escapes with 
Cedric's body. Mad-Eye Moody admits he helped Harry enter and win the tournament and 
is revealed as Barty Crouch and is trying to kill Harry. He was the Voldemort's servant 
and was the one that cast the Dark Mark. Many people don't believe that Voldemort is back. 
In the end Harry wins the Triwizard Tournament and gives his winnings to Fred and George.
The final results for the tournament were as follows:
