Chamber of Secrets
==================
     
Brief Overview
--------------

The second installment of the Harry Potter series begins with Harry living a
miserable summer with the Dursleys. Dobby, a house-elf comes to warn
Harry to not come back to Hogwarts, but Harry ignores it. Later, Ron comes
to steal Harry away from the Dursleys so he can live with the Weasleys
for the summer. 

They return to Hogwarts with the Weasley's car. On
Halloween night, a cat is petrified and a disturbing message is left
on the wall with its blood. After some research on the message,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione figured out a chamber was opened at Hogwarts
50 years ago and a student was killed. 

Harry discovers that he can speak in Parseltongue, which is 
troublesome because that is needed to open the chamber, which frightens others. 
There is a ghost, Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls bathroom. 
Through her journal, Harry meets Tom Riddle and he convinces Harry 
to be suspicious of Hagrid, but after he sends them on an excursion 
through the forest to talk to a giant spider, he is proven innocent. 

After Hermione was petrified, they discover a piece of paper with
a description of a basilisk, so they conclude the chamber's monster 
must be a basilisk. 

When entering the chamber, Harry finds Ginny Weasley and Tom Riddle,
who is a younger version of Voldemort. He was enchanting Ginny to
open the chamber. After calling to Dumbledore, a phoenix comes to blind
the basilisk as well as a hat that spawns a sword that is used to kill
the monster. Then, Harry uses its fang to destroy the book, killing Tom.
